# Naming Conventions Guide

Follow these naming conventions to organize and structure your solutions effectively.

## 1. Primary Directory:

Create a primary directory with your name in the format `FirstnameLastname`.

**Example:** `RamSingh`

## 2. Secondary Directory:

Inside your primary directory, create a secondary directory for each day using the format `DayX`, where X is the day number.

**Example:** `Day1`

## 3. Solution Files:

Inside each day's directory, create a C solution file for a problem using the format `XX.c`, where XX is the problem number. Add leading zeros before problem numbers.

**Example:** `01.c` or `011.c`

### Naming Examples:

- **Primary Directory:** `RamSingh`
  - **Secondary Directory:** `Day1`
    - **Solution File:** `01.c`
    - **Solution File:** `02.c`
  - **Secondary Directory:** `Day2`
    - **Solution File:** `01.c`
    - **Solution File:** `02.c`

## Hierarchy Table:

```plaintext
/RamSingh
|-- Day1
|   |-- 01.c
|   |-- 02.c
|-- Day2
|   |-- 01.c
|   |-- 02.c
...
```

Use this hierarchy to keep your solutions organized and make it easier for others to navigate through your submissions.

Happy coding!
