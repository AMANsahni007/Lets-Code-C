# Participant Guide: Submitting Your Solution

## Step 1: Click on the Given Link

Click on the link provided to access the bootcamp repository.

## Step 2: Generate Your Repo

A new repository will be generated specifically for you.

## Step 3: Copy Repo Link

Copy the link to your newly generated repository. This link will be used to clone the repository to your local system.

## Step 4: Clone Repo Locally

Open your terminal or Git Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone <paste-repo-link>
```
Replace <paste-repo-link> with the link you copied earlier.

## Step 5: Change Directory
Navigate to the cloned repository by using the following command:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```
Replace <repository-name> with the name of your cloned repository.

## Step 6: Create a Source File
Inside the repository directory, create a new source file to write your code solution. You can use your preferred text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

```bash
code <filename>
```

## Step 7: Write Your Solution
Write your code solution within the newly created source file. Solve the coding challenge provided in the assignment.

## Step 8: Save the File
Save your changes to the source file.

## Step 9: Stage and Commit Changes
Stage the changes and commit them to your local repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
Replace "Your commit message" with a concise message describing the changes you made.

## Step 10: Create a Pull Request
Push your changes to the remote repository and create a pull request. Use the following commands:

```bash
git push origin main
```
That's it! Your solution is now submitted. You can track the status of your pull request and engage with the community in discussions related to the coding challenge.

# Notice: Limited Write Access Period

Please be advised that you have the privilege to edit your answer from your local system until 11:00 PM of the next day. After this deadline, your write access to the solution will be restricted. 

## Important Points:

1. **Deadline:** The deadline for editing your solution is set at 11:00 PM of the day following your initial submission.

2. **Write Access Restriction:** Once the deadline passes, your ability to make further changes to your solution will be restricted.

3. **Submission Lock:** This measure is in place to ensure a fair and timely evaluation process and to encourage participants to submit their solutions within the provided timeframe.

Please make sure to complete and finalize your solution before the specified deadline. If you have any concerns or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the bootcamp organizers.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
