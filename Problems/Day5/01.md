In this programming task, your goal is to create a C program that checks whether a given positive integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.

## Theory: Perfect Number
A perfect number is a positive integer \(N\) that satisfies the following condition:
\[ \sigma(N) = 2N \]
where \(\sigma(N)\) is the sum of the proper divisors of \(N\), excluding \(N\) itself. In other words, a perfect number is equal to the sum of its positive divisors (excluding itself).

For example, the smallest perfect number is 6, as its divisors (excluding itself) are 1, 2, and 3, and \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

## Tasks

### 1. User Input
   - Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
   - Read the entered integer from the user.

### 2. Perfect Number Check
   - Write a function to determine whether the entered number is a perfect number.
   - Implement the necessary logic to find and sum the proper divisors of the number.

### 3. Output
   - Display the result to the user, indicating whether the entered number is a perfect number or not.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Include a function for perfect number checking.
- Ensure the program handles user input validation and provides clear output.
