You are tasked with developing a C program to manage the roll numbers of 36 students in a 6 by 6 grid, arranged in ascending order. Your goal is to utilize dynamic memory allocation with double pointers to achieve efficient memory management. Write a C program to implement the following tasks:

### Dynamic Memory Allocation:

Create a function named allocate_memory that takes a double pointer as a parameter and dynamically allocates memory to store the roll numbers of 36 students in a 6 by 6 grid.

### Initialize Roll Numbers:

Implement a function named initialize_roll_numbers that takes the double pointer as a parameter and initializes them in ascending order of roll number based on the 6 by 6 grid.

### Display Roll Numbers:

Develop a function named display_roll_numbers that takes the double pointer as a parameter and displays them in the 6 by 6 grid format.

### Calculate Average:

Create a function named calculate_average that takes the double pointer as a parameter and calculates and returns the average of all roll numbers.

### Deallocate Memory:

Implement a function called deallocate_roll_numbers that takes the double pointer as a parameter and frees the dynamically allocated memory. </br>


In the main function:
- Use the above functions to:
- Dynamically allocate memory for the roll numbers in a 6 by 6 grid.
- Initialize and display the roll numbers.
- Calculate and print the average roll number.
- Free the dynamically allocated memory.

### Example Output:

```
Roll Numbers:

1  2  3  4  5  6
7  8  9  10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36

Average Roll Number: 18.5
```
