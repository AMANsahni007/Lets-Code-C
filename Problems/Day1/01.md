# Welcome to the Open Source Contributors' 21 Days Online Bootcamp - **Let's Learn C**

Greetings, and welcome to our 21 Days Online Bootcamp, where we've aptly named it **Let's Learn C**. Our goal is to transform you into a proficient C programmer in just 21 days. Throughout this journey, you'll be presented with a set of challenging and fun C coding problems each day. These problems will encompass theory, complex coding scenarios, and an exploration of programming.

To kickstart this exciting journey, your task today is to introduce yourself to us in the realm of C programming. You'll be answering five questions within your code to help us get to know you better. Here are the questions:

1. Hello! what's your name?
2. Why do you want to learn C?
3. As an aspiring developer, what inspired you to pursue programming?
4. If you could create any software or application, what would it be and why?
5. As you embark on your programming journey, what positive impact do you hope to make in the tech community or beyond?

Now, let me guide you on how to begin. You'll need to prompt the questions and then answer them within a single C program. Remember, you can't modify the questions; they should be printed as they are, and all questions should be included within the same C program. Here's a template to help you get started:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];
    printf("Hello! What's your name? ");
    // Your code to get the name input here

    printf("Welcome, %s!\n", name);

    // Your code for the rest of the questions and their answers go here.

    return 0;
}
```
Remember to compile and run your program to ensure it works as expected. Additionally, provide clear and concise comments in your code.

Submission Guidelines:
- You will receive an assignment link.
- Commit your introduction answers and the C code.
- Submit a pull request when you're ready for your code to be reviewed.
We're excited to learn more about you and witness your coding skills in action! Best of luck!
