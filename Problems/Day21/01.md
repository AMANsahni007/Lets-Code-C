In the bustling schoolyard of Codeburg School, there's a 6 by 6 grid where students are engaged in physical exercises and they are arranged in order of roll no. Now, the gym teacher wants to create a program in C to manage this grid of students using pointers. The program will dynamically allocate memory for the grid using malloc and free.

## Task Explanation:
### Dynamic Memory Allocation:

The gym teacher will start by dynamically allocating memory for the 6 by 6 grid of students using malloc. This will create a 2D array of students, allowing for flexible storage.

### Random Student Interaction:

During the game, the gym teacher will randomly select a row and column number.
The selected student will then be prompted to calculate the sum and multiplication of the students roll no located two steps ahead and two steps behind him in the grid.

## Tasks for the Program:
### Create the Matrix:

Write a function to dynamically allocate memory for the 6 by 6 grid of students using malloc. Each student will be represented by a structure containing his roll no.

### Game Logic:

- Implement the game logic where the gym teacher randomly selects a row and column number.

### Calculate Sum and Multiplication:

- Write a function to calculate the sum and multiplication of the students roll no located two steps ahead and two steps behind the selected student in the grid.

### Free Memory:

After the game ends, free the dynamically allocated memory using free to prevent memory leaks.

### Example Interaction:
Gym Teacher: "Student at row 3, column 4, please tell me the sum and multiplication of the students two steps ahead and two steps behind you." </br>
Selected Student: Sum is 32 and Multiplication is 112.</br>

By implementing these tasks, the gym teacher can efficiently manage the grid of students during the game session, allowing for dynamic interaction and engagement. Happy exercising!
