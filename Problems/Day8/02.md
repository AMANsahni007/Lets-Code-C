Veer, dissatisfied with his cricket score analysis, decided to create a simple game of Stone, Paper, Scissors. As a programmer, you need to help Veer by writing a C program that implements the Stone, Paper, Scissors game.

### Program Requirements:

1. Write a C function `void stone_paper_scissors()` to implement the Stone, Paper, Scissors game logic.
   - Allow two players (Player 1 and Player 2) to make their choices.
   - Determine the winner based on the game rules: Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Stone.
   - Display the choices made by each player and announce the winner.

2. In the `main` function:
   - Call the `stone_paper_scissors` function to start and play the game.

### Constraints:

- Use simple `printf` and `scanf` statements to interact with players.
- Display the choices made by each player and the result of the game.

### Example Output:

```plaintext
Stone, Paper, Scissors Game
---------------------------
Player 1's turn. Enter your choice (1: Stone, 2: Paper, 3: Scissors): 1

Player 2's turn. Enter your choice (1: Stone, 2: Paper, 3: Scissors): 2

Player 1 chose Stone.
Player 2 chose Paper.
Player 2 wins!
```

### Your Task:
Write a C program that meets the specified requirements. Use the given constraints for the Stone, Paper, Scissors game implementation.
