In the quaint town of Codeburg, a renowned cryptographer named Professor Enigma has discovered a mysterious coded message. The townsfolk believe it holds the key to a hidden treasure! However, the message is encoded using an elaborate string manipulation technique. </br>

The professor, being a bit eccentric, has devised a series of tasks to unravel the hidden meaning. Your task is to assist in deciphering the message by using various string functions in C.

### The Coded Message:
```c
char codedMessage[] = "R1Fg)6WQs!H0$zL2vPx^E4";
```

### Tasks:
1. Remove Special Characters: Remove all special characters from the message and print the updated string.

2. Extract Digits: Extract all numerical digits from the message and print them as a separate string.

3. Reverse Words: Reverse the order of characters in the message and print the updated string.

4. Replace Numbers: Replace numerical digits with their English word equivalents (e.g., replace "1" with "One") and print the extracted digits message.

5. Caesar Cipher Decryption: Decrypt the message using a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3, and print the deciphered string.

6. Count Vowels and Consonants: Count the number of vowels and consonants in the deciphered string, and print the counts.

Remember to provide the C program that includes functions for each task, and display the results after each manipulation. Happy codebreaking!
