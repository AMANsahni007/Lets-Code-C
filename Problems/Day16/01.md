Your task is to create a simple C program focusing on basic pointer arithmetic concepts. 
Use the provided theory to guide your implementation. This will be coded in single C source code file.

### Access Array Elements:

1. Declare an integer array named data with values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
2. Declare a pointer ptr_data and initialize it to point to the first element of the array.
3. Use pointer arithmetic to print the values at the third and fifth positions of the array.

### Increment and Decrement Operations:

1. Declare a float array named prices with values {5.5, 10.2, 15.8, 20.3}.
2. Declare a pointer ptr_prices and initialize it to point to the second element of the array.
3. Use increment and decrement operations to print the values of the next and previous elements from the one pointed to by ptr_prices.

### Array Navigation:

1. Declare a character array named letters with values {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}.
2. Declare a pointer ptr_letters and initialize it to point to the first element of the array.
3. Use pointer arithmetic to print the values of the elements at indices 1 and 4.

### Comparison of Pointers:

1. Declare two integer arrays, arr1 with values {1, 2, 3} and arr2 with values {4, 5, 6}.
2. Declare pointers ptr1 and ptr2 and initialize them to point to the first elements of arr1 and arr2, respectively.
3. Compare the pointers and print a message indicating which array comes first in memory.

Ensure that your program provides clear output messages for each step.
