In the Island of Sodor, the Thomas the Tank Engine is one of the the main mode of transportation. Thomas runs on a single-track route with several stations, each identified by a unique station ID. The timetable needs to be managed using basic C programming concepts.

### The Problem:
Your task is to create a simple C program to manage the Thomas's timetable. Stations are represented by a structure containing the station ID, name, and arrival time.

### Struct Definition:

```c
struct Station {
    int stationID;
    char stationName[50];
    char arrivalTime[10];
};
```
### Tasks:
1. Create Timetable: Declare an array to represent the train timetable, where each element is a structure representing a station. Initialize the array with sample stations given below.

2. Display Timetable: Write a function to display the entire train timetable. Traverse the array and print each station's ID, name, and arrival time.

3. Search by ID: Write a function to search for a station by its ID. Print the station's details if found; otherwise, indicate that the station is not on the route.

4. Update Arrival Time: Write a function to update the arrival time of a specific station. Take the station's ID and the new arrival time as parameters.

Now, as the Thomas embarks on his journey, use these functions to manage the Thomas's timetable efficiently. Use Thomas's timetable given below. Happy Coding!
