In this programming task, your goal is to create a C program that manages student records using a structure. The structure should include fields for phone number, roll number, address, class, section, and total marks obtained out of 500. The program should allow the user to input details for five students and then provide functions to display individual student details based on roll number and calculate/display the percentage of marks obtained for each student.

## Tasks

### 1. Define Structure
   - Create a structure named `Student` to store details such as name, roll number, and total marks obtained out of 500.

### 2. Input Student Details
   - Create a function to input details for two  students using the `Student` structure.

### 3. Display Student Details
   - Create a function to display details of a student.

### 4. Calculate and Display Percentage
   - Create a function to calculate the percentage of marks obtained for each student and display the result.

### 5. Main Program
   - In the main program, call the functions to input details, display details, and calculate/display percentages.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Use a structure (`Student`) to manage student records.
- Implement functions to input student details, display details, and calculate/display percentages.
- Ensure the program handles different data types appropriately.
- Provide clear and organized output.

## Submission
- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain the approach taken to manage student records and any key decisions made during the implementation.
