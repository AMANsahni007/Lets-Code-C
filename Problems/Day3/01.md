Your task is to create a C program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence for a given number. The program should take user input, generate the Fibonacci sequence, and display the result.

## Theory: Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \] 

with initial conditions:

\[ F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \]

The first few numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

## Tasks

### 1. User Input
   - Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
   - Read the entered integer from the user.

### 2. Fibonacci Calculation
   - Write a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence for the entered number.
   - Implement the necessary logic to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

### 3. Output
   - Display the Fibonacci sequence to the user.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Include a function for Fibonacci sequence calculation.
- Ensure the program handles user input validation and provides clear output.

## Submission
- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain the approach taken to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and any key decisions made during the implementation.
