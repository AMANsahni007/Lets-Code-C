You are tasked with implementing a program in C that utilizes dynamic memory allocation and pointers to manage a list of integers. The program should perform the following tasks:

Allocate List:

- Create a function called allocate_list that takes an integer parameter size representing the number of elements in the list. Inside this function, dynamically allocate memory to store the list of integers.

Populate List:

- Create a function named populate_list that takes two parameters: the dynamically allocated list and its size. Inside this function, prompt the user to enter integer values for each element of the list.

Display List:

- Implement a function named display_list that takes the dynamically allocated list and its size as parameters. This function should display the elements of the list.

Calculate Sum:

- Create a function named calculate_sum that takes the dynamically allocated list and its size as parameters. Calculate and return the sum of all elements in the list.

Deallocation:

- Implement a function called deallocate_list that takes the dynamically allocated list as a parameter and frees the allocated memory.
Main Program:

In the main program, use the above functions to:
- Dynamically allocate memory for a list of integers with a user-specified size.
- Populate the list with user-inputted integer values.
- Display the elements of the list.
- Calculate and print the sum of all elements.
- Free the dynamically allocated memory.
- Ensure that your program handles memory allocation failures gracefully and validates user inputs appropriately.

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Enter the size of the list: 5
Enter integer values for the list:
Element 1: 10
Element 2: 20
Element 3: 30
Element 4: 40
Element 5: 50

The elements of the list are: 10 20 30 40 50
The sum of the elements is: 150
```
