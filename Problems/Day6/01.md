In this programming task, your objective is to create a C program that continuously adds numbers entered by the user until the user inputs zero. The program should calculate and display the sum of all entered numbers.

## Tasks

### 1. User Input
   - Prompt the user to enter a number (integer or floating-point).
   - Continue to prompt for input until the user enters zero.

### 2. Sum Calculation
   - Implement logic to continuously add the entered numbers.
   - Keep track of the cumulative sum.

### 3. Output
   - Display the final sum to the user after the input of zero is received.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Implement a loop to keep receiving user input until zero is entered.
- Ensure the program handles different numeric input types (integer or floating-point).
- Provide clear output of the sum.

## Submission
- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain the approach taken to continuously add numbers and any key decisions made during the implementation.
