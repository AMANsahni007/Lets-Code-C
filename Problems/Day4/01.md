Your task is to create a C program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program should take user input, perform the factorial calculation, and display the result.

## Theory: Factorial
Factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \).
By convention, the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1: \( 0! = 1 \).

## Tasks

### 1. User Input
   - Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.
   - Read the entered integer from the user.

### 2. Factorial Calculation (Recursion)
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the entered number.
   - Implement the necessary logic to perform the recursive calculation.

### 3. Output
   - Display the factorial of the entered number to the user.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Include a recursive function for factorial calculation.
- Ensure the program handles user input validation and provides clear output.

## Submission
- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain the approach taken to calculate the factorial using recursion and any key decisions made during the implementation.
