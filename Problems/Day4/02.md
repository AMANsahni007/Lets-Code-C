Doraemon, the robotic cat from the 22nd century, loves programming almost as much as he loves Dora Cakes. One day, he decided to write a program to bake Dora Cakes whenever he is in Nobita's room. However, he wants the program to behave differently based on who enters the room.

### Your Task:

Write a C program for Doraemon's Dora Cakes program using `switch`, `break`, and `continue` statements. Implement the following logic:

1. **Input:**
   - Ask the user to input who entered the room (1 for Nobita's mom, 2 for Nobita, 3 for others).
   - Use a `switch` statement to handle different cases based on the input.

2. **Bake Dora Cakes:**
   - If Nobita's mom enters (input is 1), Doraemon should pause baking and say, "Nobita's mom is here. Pausing Dora Cake baking!"
   - If Nobita enters (input is 2), Doraemon should continue baking and say, "Nobita is here. Continuing Dora Cake baking!"
   - If others enter (input is 3), Doraemon should break out of the baking loop and say, "Someone else is here. Stopping Dora Cake baking!"

3. **Loop:**
   - Use a loop to simulate the baking process until interrupted by Nobita's mom or others.

Note:
- Use the switch statement to handle different cases based on the input.
- Implement the appropriate actions using break and continue to control the baking process.
- Make sure the program handles invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter a valid option.
Doraemon will be pleased if you can successfully simulate his Dora Cakes program with this logic!
