Your task is to create a C program that checks whether a given integer is a prime number. The program should take user input, perform the prime number check, and provide output indicating whether the entered number is prime or not.

## Tasks

### 1. User Input
   - Prompt the user to enter a non zero positive integer.
   - Read the entered integer from the user.

### 2. Prime Number Check
   - Write a function to determine whether the entered number is a prime number.
   - Implement the necessary logic to check for divisibility by numbers other than 1 and itself.

### 3. Output
   - Display the result to the user, indicating whether the entered number is prime or not.

## Requirements
- Develop a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Include a function for prime number checking.
- Ensure the program handles user input validation and provides clear output.

## Submission
- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain the approach taken to check for prime numbers and any key decisions made during the implementation.
