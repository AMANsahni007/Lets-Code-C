In this programming task, you are tasked with creating a C program that determines whether a given integer is even or odd. The program should take user input, check the entered number, and provide output indicating whether it's an even or odd number.

## Tasks:

### User Input:

- Prompt the user to enter an integer.
- Read the entered integer from the user.

### Check Even or Odd:

- Use a conditional statement (if-else) to check if the entered number is even or odd.
- If the remainder when divided by 2 is zero, then it's even; otherwise, it's odd.

## Output:

Display the result to the user, stating whether the entered number is even or odd.

## Requirements:

- Write a C program that follows the outlined tasks.
- Ensure the program handles user input correctly and provides clear output.

## Submission:

- Submit the C code for your program.
- Explain any important decisions or considerations made while writing the code.
