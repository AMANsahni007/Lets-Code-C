# Hotel Booking Management System

You are tasked with creating a program to manage bookings for a hotel with three buildings, each having 10 floors, and each floor containing 20 rooms. The hotel buildings are labeled A, B, and C.

## Program Requirements:

1. **Initialize Hotel Data:**
   - Create a 3D array to represent the hotel structure, where the dimensions are building (A, B, C), floor (1 to 10), and room (1 to 20).
   - Initialize the rooms with sample data, marking some as occupied and others as empty.

2. **Display Room Status:**
   -Display the status of a room (occupied or empty).

3. **Update Number of Guests:**
   - Update the number of guests staying in a specific room.
   - The user should input the building, floor, room number and no of guests, and the program should update the corresponding room with the entered number of guests.

## Sample Data:

Initialize the hotel data with the following sample information:

- Rooms in building A, floor 1 to 3, are marked as occupied with 1 guest and rest are empty.
- Rooms in building B, floor 4 to 6, are marked as empty and rest are occupied with 2 guests in each.
- Rooms in building C, floor 7 to 10, are alternately occupied (with 1 guest) and empty whereas floor 1 to 3 are empty and floor 4 to 6 are occupied with 2 guests in each.


## Additional Considerations:

- You may consider adding error-checking mechanisms to handle invalid inputs or prevent overbooking.
- Think about how to efficiently display the status of all rooms without overwhelming the user with information.
